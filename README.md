# Mr. Tates house
## Our Game Idea:
### This game is a first-person horror escape experience inspired by the classic game Granny. The player is trapped inside a dark, maze house and must explore to find items, solve simple puzzles, and unlock paths to escape. Making noise or moving carelessly can alert the hostile Elizabeth Warren enemy that roams the house. Limited visibility, environmental obstacles, and constant looking behind you create a suspenseful atmosphere where planning and patience are essential for survival.
